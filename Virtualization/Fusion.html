        <h2>Error -14 pipe connection has been broken</h2>
        <p>If you have this issue when you try to start a VM, also if is a new one, the problem is that the SIP (Sistem Integrity Protection) is blocking the MV execution
            for resolve this, you have to disable it, <a href="../macOS/SIP.html">see here how to do</a>
