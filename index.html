    <h2>Sideloading</h2>
    <p>Sideloading is a method to install apps on your iOS device without using the App Store. It allows you to run apps that are not available in the official store, often used for testing or using custom applications.</p>

    <h2>Jailbreak</h2>
    <p>Jailbreaking is the process of removing software restrictions imposed by iOS, allowing users to gain root access to the operating system. This enables the installation of unauthorized apps, tweaks, and customizations.</p>
    <p style="color: red;"><strong>I tell you immediately that if you are on iOS 16.6 or higher you can't Jailbreak, perhaps is an iPhone X or 8</strong></p>
